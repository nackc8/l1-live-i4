[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     [1mssh-keygen[0m generates, manages and converts authentication keys for ssh(1).[m
     [1mssh-keygen[0m can create keys for use by SSH protocol version 2.[m
[m
     The type of key to be generated is specified with the [1m-t[0m option.  If invoked[m
     without any arguments, [1mssh-keygen[0m will generate an RSA key.[m
[m
     [1mssh-keygen[0m is also used to generate groups for use in Diffie-Hellman group[m
     exchange (DH-GEX).  See the [4mMODULI[24m [4mGENERATION[24m section for details.[m
[m
     Finally, [1mssh-keygen[0m can be used to generate and update Key Revocation Lists,[m
[7m Manual page ssh-keygen(1) line 40 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     and to test whether given keys have been revoked by one.  See the [4mKEY[24m[m
     [4mREVOCATION[24m [4mLISTS[24m section for details.[m
[m
     Normally each user wishing to use SSH with public key authentication runs[m
     this once to create the authentication key in [4m~/.ssh/id_dsa[24m,[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_ecdsa[24m, [4m~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk[24m, [4m~/.ssh/id_ed25519[24m, [4m~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk[24m[m
     or [4m~/.ssh/id_rsa[24m.  Additionally, the system administrator may use this to[m
     generate host keys.[m
[m
     Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which to[m
     store the private key.  The public key is stored in a file with the same[m
     name but ‚Äú.pub‚Äù appended.  The program also asks for a passphrase.  The[m
     passphrase may be empty to indicate no passphrase (host keys must have an[m
[7m Manual page ssh-keygen(1) line 53 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     empty passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length.  A passphrase[m
     is similar to a password, except it can be a phrase with a series of words,[m
     punctuation, numbers, whitespace, or any string of characters you want.[m
     Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are not simple sentences or oth‚Äê[m
     erwise easily guessable (English prose has only 1-2 bits of entropy per[m
     character, and provides very bad passphrases), and contain a mix of upper[m
     and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.  The[m
     passphrase can be changed later by using the [1m-p[0m option.[m
[m
     There is no way to recover a lost passphrase.  If the passphrase is lost or[m
     forgotten, a new key must be generated and the corresponding public key[m
     copied to other machines.[m
[m
[7m Manual page ssh-keygen(1) line 66 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     [1mssh-keygen[0m will by default write keys in an OpenSSH-specific format.  This[m
     format is preferred as it offers better protection for keys at rest as well[m
     as allowing storage of key comments within the private key file itself.  The[m
     key comment may be useful to help identify the key.  The comment is initial‚Äê[m
     ized to ‚Äúuser@host‚Äù when the key is created, but can be changed using the [1m-c[0m[m
     option.[m
[m
     It is still possible for [1mssh-keygen[0m to write the previously-used PEM format[m
     private keys using the [1m-m[0m flag.  This may be used when generating new keys,[m
     and existing new-format keys may be converted using this option in conjunc‚Äê[m
     tion with the [1m-p[0m (change passphrase) flag.[m
[m
     After a key is generated, [1mssh-keygen[0m will ask where the keys should be[m
[7m Manual page ssh-keygen(1) line 79 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     placed to be activated.[m
[m
     The options are as follows:[m
[m

             ed25519) if they do not already exist.  The host keys are generated[m
             with the default key file path, an empty passphrase, default bits[m
             for the key type, and default comment.  If [1m-f[0m has also been speci‚Äê[m
             fied, its argument is used as a prefix to the default path for the[m
             resulting host key files.  This is used by system administration[m
             scripts to generate new host keys.[m
