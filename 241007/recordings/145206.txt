[m
[1mAUTHENTICATION[0m[m
     The OpenSSH SSH client supports SSH protocol 2.[m
[m
     The methods available for authentication are: GSSAPI-based authentication, host-based authen‚Äê[m
     tication, public key authentication, keyboard-interactive authentication, and password authen‚Äê[m
     tication.  Authentication methods are tried in the order specified above, though[m
     [1mPreferredAuthentications[0m can be used to change the default order.[m
[m
     Host-based authentication works as follows: If the machine the user logs in from is listed in[m
     [4m/etc/hosts.equiv[24m or [4m/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv[24m on the remote machine, the user is non-root and the[m
     user names are the same on both sides, or if the files [4m~/.rhosts[24m or [4m~/.shosts[24m exist in the[m
     user's home directory on the remote machine and contain a line containing the name of the[m
     client machine and the name of the user on that machine, the user is considered for login.[m
     Additionally, the server [4mmust[24m be able to verify the client's host key (see the description of[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 416 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     [4m/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts[24m and [4m~/.ssh/known_hosts[24m, below) for login to be permitted.  This au‚Äê[m
     thentication method closes security holes due to IP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and routing spoof‚Äê[m
     ing.  [Note to the administrator: [4m/etc/hosts.equiv[24m, [4m~/.rhosts[24m, and the rlogin/rsh protocol in[m
     general, are inherently insecure and should be disabled if security is desired.][m
[m
     Public key authentication works as follows: The scheme is based on public-key cryptography,[m
     using cryptosystems where encryption and decryption are done using separate keys, and it is[m
     unfeasible to derive the decryption key from the encryption key.  The idea is that each user[m
     creates a public/private key pair for authentication purposes.  The server knows the public[m
     key, and only the user knows the private key.  [1mssh[0m implements public key authentication proto‚Äê[m
     col automatically, using one of the DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA algorithms.  The HISTORY sec‚Äê[m
     tion of ssl(8) (on non-OpenBSD systems, see[m
     http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&sektion=8#HISTORY) contains a brief discus‚Äê[m
     sion of the DSA and RSA algorithms.[m
[m
     The file [4m~/.ssh/authorized_keys[24m lists the public keys that are permitted for logging in.  When[m
     the user logs in, the [1mssh[0m program tells the server which key pair it would like to use for au‚Äê[m
     thentication.  The client proves that it has access to the private key and the server checks[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 434 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     that the corresponding public key is authorized to accept the account.[m
[m
     The server may inform the client of errors that prevented public key authentication from suc‚Äê[m
     ceeding after authentication completes using a different method.  These may be viewed by in‚Äê[m
     creasing the [1mLogLevel[0m to [1mDEBUG[0m or higher (e.g. by using the [1m-v[0m flag).[m
[m
     The user creates their key pair by running ssh-keygen(1).  This stores the private key in[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_dsa[24m (DSA), [4m~/.ssh/id_ecdsa[24m (ECDSA), [4m~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk[24m (authenticator-hosted ECDSA),[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_ed25519[24m (Ed25519), [4m~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk[24m (authenticator-hosted Ed25519), or[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_rsa[24m (RSA) and stores the public key in [4m~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub[24m (DSA), [4m~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub[24m[m
     (ECDSA), [4m~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub[24m (authenticator-hosted ECDSA), [4m~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub[24m (Ed25519),[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk.pub[24m (authenticator-hosted Ed25519), or [4m~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub[24m (RSA) in the[m
     user's home directory.  The user should then copy the public key to [4m~/.ssh/authorized_keys[24m in[m
     their home directory on the remote machine.  The [4mauthorized_keys[24m file corresponds to the con‚Äê[m
     ventional [4m~/.rhosts[24m file, and has one key per line, though the lines can be very long.  After[m
     this, the user can log in without giving the password.[m
[m
     A variation on public key authentication is available in the form of certificate authentica‚Äê[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 452 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     tion: instead of a set of public/private keys, signed certificates are used.  This has the ad‚Äê[m
     vantage that a single trusted certification authority can be used in place of many public/pri‚Äê[m
     vate keys.  See the CERTIFICATES section of ssh-keygen(1) for more information.[m
[m
     The most convenient way to use public key or certificate authentication may be with an authen‚Äê[m
     tication agent.  See ssh-agent(1) and (optionally) the [1mAddKeysToAgent[0m directive in[m
     ssh_config(5) for more information.[m
[m
     Keyboard-interactive authentication works as follows: The server sends an arbitrary[m
     "challenge" text and prompts for a response, possibly multiple times.  Examples of keyboard-[m
     interactive authentication include BSD Authentication (see login.conf(5)) and PAM (some[m
     non-OpenBSD systems).[m
[m
     Finally, if other authentication methods fail, [1mssh[0m prompts the user for a password.  The pass‚Äê[m
     word is sent to the remote host for checking; however, since all communications are encrypted,[m
     the password cannot be seen by someone listening on the network.[m
[m
     [1mssh[0m automatically maintains and checks a database containing identification for all hosts it[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 470 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     has ever been used with.  Host keys are stored in [4m~/.ssh/known_hosts[24m in the user's home direc‚Äê[m
     tory.  Additionally, the file [4m/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts[24m is automatically checked for known[m
     hosts.  Any new hosts are automatically added to the user's file.  If a host's identification[m
     ever changes, [1mssh[0m warns about this and disables password authentication to prevent server[m
     spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks, which could otherwise be used to circumvent the encryp‚Äê[m
     tion.  The [1mStrictHostKeyChecking[0m option can be used to control logins to machines whose host[m
     key is not known or has changed.[m
[m
     When the user's identity has been accepted by the server, the server either executes the given[m
     command in a non-interactive session or, if no command has been specified, logs into the ma‚Äê[m
     chine and gives the user a normal shell as an interactive session.  All communication with the[m
     remote command or shell will be automatically encrypted.[m
[m
     If an interactive session is requested, [1mssh[0m by default will only request a pseudo-terminal[m
     (pty) for interactive sessions when the client has one.  The flags [1m-T[0m and [1m-t[0m can be used to[m
     override this behaviour.[m
[m
     If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the user may use the escape characters noted below.[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 488 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K[m
     If no pseudo-terminal has been allocated, the session is transparent and can be used to reli‚Äê[m
     ably transfer binary data.  On most systems, setting the escape character to ‚Äúnone‚Äù will also[m
     make the session transparent even if a tty is used.[m
[m
     The session terminates when the command or shell on the remote machine exits and all X11 and[m
     TCP connections have been closed.[m
[m
[1mESCAPE[0m [1mCHARACTERS[0m[m
     When a pseudo-terminal has been requested, [1mssh[0m supports a number of functions through the use[m
     of an escape character.[m
[m
     A single tilde character can be sent as [1m~~[0m or by following the tilde by a character other than[m
     those described below.  The escape character must always follow a newline to be interpreted as[m
     special.  The escape character can be changed in configuration files using the [1mEscapeChar[0m con‚Äê[m

     Forwarding of arbitrary TCP connections over a secure channel can be specified either on the[m
     command line or in a configuration file.  One possible application of TCP forwarding is a se‚Äê[m
     cure connection to a mail server; another is going through firewalls.[m
[m
     In the example below, we look at encrypting communication for an IRC client, even though the[m
     IRC server it connects to does not directly support encrypted communication.  This works as[m
     follows: the user connects to the remote host using [1mssh[0m, specifying the ports to be used to[m
     forward the connection.  After that it is possible to start the program locally, and [1mssh[0m will[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 542 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     encrypt and forward the connection to the remote server.[m
[m
     The following example tunnels an IRC session from the client to an IRC server at[m
     ‚Äúserver.example.com‚Äù, joining channel ‚Äú#users‚Äù, nickname ‚Äúpinky‚Äù, using the standard IRC port,[m

[m
     The [1m-f[0m option backgrounds [1mssh[0m and the remote command ‚Äúsleep 10‚Äù is specified to allow an[m
     amount of time (10 seconds, in the example) to start the program which is going to use the[m
     tunnel.  If no connections are made within the time specified, [1mssh[0m will exit.[m

     tions above) and the user is using X11 (the DISPLAY environment variable is set), the connec‚Äê[m
     tion to the X11 display is automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way that any[m
     X11 programs started from the shell (or command) will go through the encrypted channel, and[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 560 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     the connection to the real X server will be made from the local machine.  The user should not[m

     in configuration files.[m
[m
     The DISPLAY value set by [1mssh[0m will point to the server machine, but with a display number[m
     greater than zero.  This is normal, and happens because [1mssh[0m creates a ‚Äúproxy‚Äù X server on the[m
     server machine for forwarding the connections over the encrypted channel.[m
[m
     [1mssh[0m will also automatically set up Xauthority data on the server machine.  For this purpose,[m
     it will generate a random authorization cookie, store it in Xauthority on the server, and ver‚Äê[m
     ify that any forwarded connections carry this cookie and replace it by the real cookie when[m
     the connection is opened.  The real authentication cookie is never sent to the server machine[m

     When connecting to a server for the first time, a fingerprint of the server's public key is[m
     presented to the user (unless the option [1mStrictHostKeyChecking[0m has been disabled).  Finger‚Äê[m
     prints can be determined using ssh-keygen(1):[m
[m
           $ ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key[m
[m
     If the fingerprint is already known, it can be matched and the key can be accepted or re‚Äê[m
     jected.  If only legacy (MD5) fingerprints for the server are available, the ssh-keygen(1) [1m-E[0m[m
     option may be used to downgrade the fingerprint algorithm to match.[m
[m
     Because of the difficulty of comparing host keys just by looking at fingerprint strings, there[m
     is also support to compare host keys visually, using [4mrandom[24m [4mart[24m.  By setting the [1mVisualHostKey[0m[m
     option to ‚Äúyes‚Äù, a small ASCII graphic gets displayed on every login to a server, no matter if[m
     the session itself is interactive or not.  By learning the pattern a known server produces, a[m
     user can easily find out that the host key has changed when a completely different pattern is[m
     displayed.  Because these patterns are not unambiguous however, a pattern that looks similar[m
     to the pattern remembered only gives a good probability that the host key is the same, not[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 596 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     guaranteed proof.[m
[m
     To get a listing of the fingerprints along with their random art for all known hosts, the fol‚Äê[m
     lowing command line can be used:[m
[m
           $ ssh-keygen -lv -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts[m
[m
     If the fingerprint is unknown, an alternative method of verification is available: SSH finger‚Äê[m
     prints verified by DNS.  An additional resource record (RR), SSHFP, is added to a zonefile and[m
     the connecting client is able to match the fingerprint with that of the key presented.[m
[m
     In this example, we are connecting a client to a server, ‚Äúhost.example.com‚Äù.  The SSHFP re‚Äê[m
     source records should first be added to the zonefile for host.example.com:[m
[m
           $ ssh-keygen -r host.example.com.[m
[m
     The output lines will have to be added to the zonefile.  To check that the zone is answering[m

[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 614 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K[m
           $ dig -t SSHFP host.example.com[m
[m

           2.   user's configuration file ([4m~/.ssh/config[24m)[m

[m
     For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.  The configuration files contain[m
     sections separated by [1mHost[0m specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts that[m
     match one of the patterns given in the specification.  The matched host name is usually the[m
     one given on the command line (see the [1mCanonicalizeHostname[0m option for exceptions).[m
