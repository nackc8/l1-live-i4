       [4mlaration[24m  commands).   When  in  [4mposix[24m [4mmode[24m, these builtins may appear in a[m
       command after one or more instances of the [1mcommand[0m builtin and retain these[m

[m
       In  the  context  where  an  assignment statement is assigning a value to a[m
       shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used to append to  or[m
       add  to  the variable's previous value.  This includes arguments to builtin[m
       commands such as [1mdeclare[0m that  accept  assignment  statements  ([4mdeclaration[24m[m
       commands).   When  += is applied to a variable for which the [1minteger[0m attri‚Äê[m
       bute has been set, [4mvalue[24m is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added[m
       to  the  variable's current value, which is also evaluated.  When += is ap‚Äê[m
       plied to an array variable using compound assignment  (see  [1mArrays[0m  below),[m
       the  variable's  value is not unset (as it is when using =), and new values[m
       are appended to the array beginning at one greater than the array's maximum[m
       index (for indexed arrays) or added as additional key-value pairs in an as‚Äê[m

[7m Manual page bash(1) line 121 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       When [1mbash[0m is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive[m

[m
       When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, [1mbash[0m  reads[m
       and  executes  commands from [4m/etc/bash.bashrc[24m and [4m~/.bashrc[24m, if these files[m
       exist.  This may be inhibited by using the  [1m--norc[0m  option.   The  [1m--rcfile[0m[m
       [4mfile[24m  option will force [1mbash[0m to read and execute commands from [4mfile[24m instead[m
       of [4m/etc/bash.bashrc[24m and [4m~/.bashrc[24m.[m
[m
       When [1mbash[0m is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example,[m
       it looks for the variable [1mBASH_ENV[0m in the environment, expands its value if[m
[7m Manual page bash(1) line 141 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read[m
       and execute.  [1mBash[0m behaves as if the following command were executed:[m
              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi[m
       but the value of the [1mPATH[0m variable is not used to search for the filename.[m
[m
       If [1mbash[0m is invoked with the name [1msh[0m, it tries to mimic the startup behavior[m
       of historical versions of [1msh[0m as closely as possible,  while  conforming  to[m
       the POSIX standard as well.  When invoked as an interactive login shell, or[m
       a non-interactive shell with the [1m--login[0m option, it first attempts to  read[m
       and  execute commands from [4m/etc/profile[24m and [4m~/.profile[24m, in that order.  The[m
       [1m--noprofile[0m option may be used to inhibit this behavior.  When  invoked  as[m
       an interactive shell with the name [1msh[0m, [1mbash[0m looks for the variable [1mENV[0m, ex‚Äê[m
       pands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value as  the  name[m
       of  a  file  to read and execute.  Since a shell invoked as [1msh[0m does not at‚Äê[m
       tempt to read and execute commands from any other startup files, the  [1m--rc‚Äê[0m[m
       [1mfile[0m  option  has no effect.  A non-interactive shell invoked with the name[m
       [1msh[0m does not attempt to read any other startup files.  When invoked  as  [1msh[0m,[m
       [1mbash[0m enters [4mposix[24m mode after the startup files are read.[m

       and are readable.  It will not do this if invoked as [1msh[0m.  The [1m--norc[0m option[m
       may  be  used to inhibit this behavior, and the [1m--rcfile[0m option may be used[m

[m
       An additional binary operator, [1m=~[0m, is available, with the  same  precedence[m
       as  [1m==[0m and [1m!=[0m.  When it is used, the string to the right of the operator is[m

       matches itself, instead of having any special pattern matching meaning.  If[m
       the  pattern  is stored in a shell variable, quoting the variable expansion[m
       forces the entire pattern to be matched literally.  Treat  bracket  expres‚Äê[m

       All of the single-character shell options documented in the description of[m
       the [1mset[0m builtin command, including [1m-o[0m, can be used  as  options  when  the[m
       shell is invoked.  In addition, [1mbash[0m interprets the following options when[m
       it is invoked:[m
[m
       [1m-c[0m        If the [1m-c[0m option is present, then commands  are  read  from  the[m

                 to [1m$0[0m and any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional[m
                 parameters.  The assignment to [1m$0[0m sets the name  of  the  shell,[m

              pipefail     the return value of a pipeline is the status of

              posix        change the behavior of bash where the default
                           operation differs from the Posix standard to
                           match the standard

      -p  Turned on whenever the real and effective user ids do not match.
          Disables processing of the $ENV file and importing of shell
          functions.  Turning this option off causes the effective uid and
          gid to be set to the real uid and gid.
      -t  Exit after reading and executing one command.
      -u  Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
      -v  Print shell input lines as they are read.
      -x  Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.
      -B  the shell will perform brace expansion
      -C  If set, disallow existing regular files to be overwritten
          by redirection of output.
      -E  If set, the ERR trap is inherited by shell functions.
      -H  Enable ! style history substitution.  This flag is on
          by default when the shell is interactive.
      -P  If set, do not resolve symbolic links when executing commands
          such as cd which change the current directory.
      -T  If set, the DEBUG and RETURN traps are inherited by shell functions.
      --  Assign any remaining arguments to the positional parameters.
          If there are no remaining arguments, the positional parameters
          are unset.
      -   Assign any remaining arguments to the positional parameters.
          The -x and -v options are turned off.
    
    Using + rather than - causes these flags to be turned off.  The
    flags can also be used upon invocation of the shell.  The current
    set of flags may be found in $-.  The remaining n ARGs are positional
    parameters and are assigned, in order, to $1, $2, .. $n.  If no
    ARGs are given, all shell variables are printed.
    
    Exit Status:
    Returns success unless an invalid option is given.
