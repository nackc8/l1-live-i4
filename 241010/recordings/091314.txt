[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mnano  [22mis a small and friendly editor.  It copies[m
       the look and feel of Pico, but is free software,[m
       and implements several features that Pico lacks,[m
       such as: opening multiple files,  scrolling  per[m
       line,  undo/redo,  syntax coloring, line number‚Äê[m
       ing, and soft-wrapping overlong lines.[m
[7mual page nano(1) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K[m
       When giving a filename on the command line,  the[m
       cursor  can  be put on a specific line by adding[m
       the line number with a plus sign ([1m+[22m) before  the[m
       filename,  and  even  in  a  specific  column by[m
       adding it with a comma.  (Negative numbers count[m
       from the end of the file or line.)   The  cursor[m
       can  be put on the first or last occurrence of a[m
       specific string by specifying that string  after[m
       [1m+/ [22mor [1m+? [22mbefore the filename.  The string can be[m
       made  case  sensitive and/or caused to be inter‚Äê[m
       preted as a regular expression  by  inserting  [1mc[0m[m
       and/or  [1mr  [22mafter the [1m+ [22msign.  These search modes[m
       can be explicitly disabled by using  the  upper‚Äê[m
       case variant of those letters: [1mC [22mand/or [1mR[22m.  When[m
       the  string  contains spaces, it needs to be en‚Äê[m
       closed in quotes.  To give an example: to open a[m
[7mal page nano(1) line 18 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       file at the first occurrence of the word  "Foo",[m
       you would do:[m
[m
           [1mnano +c/Foo [4m[22mfile[0m[m
[m
       As  a  special  case: if instead of a filename a[m
       dash ([1m-[22m) is given,  [1mnano  [22mwill  read  data  from[m
       standard input.[m
[m
[1mEDITING[0m[m
       Entering  text  and  moving  around in a file is[m
       straightforward: typing the  letters  and  using[m
       the  normal  cursor movement keys.  Commands are[m
       entered by using the Control (^) and the Alt  or[m
       Meta  (M-)  keys.  Typing [1m^K [22mdeletes the current[m
       line and puts it in the cutbuffer.   Consecutive[m
       [1m^K[22ms  will  put all deleted lines together in the[m
[7mal page nano(1) line 35 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       cutbuffer.  Any cursor movement or executing any[m
       other command will cause the next  [1m^K  [22mto  over‚Äê[m
       write  the  cutbuffer.  A [1m^U [22mwill paste the cur‚Äê[m
       rent contents of the cutbuffer  at  the  current[m
       cursor position.[m
[m
       When  a  more  precise piece of text needs to be[m
       cut or copied, you can mark its start  with  [1m^6[22m,[m
       move the cursor to its end (the marked text will[m
       be  highlighted),  and then use [1m^K [22mto cut it, or[m
       [1mM-6 [22mto copy it to the cutbuffer.  You  can  also[m
       save the marked text to a file with [1m^O[22m, or spell[m
       check it with [1m^T^T[22m.[m
[m
       On  some terminals, text can be selected also by[m
       holding down Shift while using the  arrow  keys.[m
       Holding  down  the  Ctrl or Alt key too will in‚Äê[m
[7mal page nano(1) line 52 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K       crease the stride.  Any cursor movement  without[m
       Shift being held will cancel such a selection.[m
[m
       Any  valid  Unicode  code  point can be inserted[m
       into the buffer by typing [1mM-V  [22mfollowed  by  the[m
       hexadecimal  digits of the code point (concluded[m
       with [1m<Space> [22mor [1m<Enter> [22mwhen it are  fewer  than[m
       six digits).  A literal control code (except [1m^J[22m)[m
       can  be  inserted  by typing [1mM-V [22mfollowed by the[m
       pertinent keystroke.[m
[m
       The two lines at the bottom of the  screen  show[m
       some  important commands; the built-in help ([1m^G[22m)[m
       lists all the available ones.  The  default  key[m
       bindings can be changed via a [4mnanorc[24m file -- see[m
       [1mnanorc[22m(5).[m

              ning  of  non-whitespace  characters on a[m
              line, the cursor will jump to that begin‚Äê[m
              ning (either forwards or backwards).   If[m
