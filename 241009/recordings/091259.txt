[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     [1mssh[0m (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote ma‚Äê[m
     chine and for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is[m
     intended to provide secure encrypted communications between[m
     two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.  X11 connec‚Äê[m
     tions, arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX-domain sockets can also be[m
     forwarded over the secure channel.[m
[m
     [1mssh[0m connects and logs into the specified [4mdestination[24m, which[m
     may be specified as either [user@]hostname or a URI of the[m
     form ssh://[user@]hostname[:port].  The user must prove their[m
     identity to the remote machine using one of several methods[m
     (see below).[m
[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 16 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     If a [4mcommand[24m is specified, it will be executed on the remote[m
     host instead of a login shell.  A complete command line may be[m
     specified as [4mcommand[24m, or it may have additional arguments.  If[m
     supplied, the arguments will be appended to the command, sepa‚Äê[m
     rated by spaces, before it is sent to the server to be exe‚Äê[m

             the remote host (for the agent's UNIX-domain socket)[m
             can access the local agent through the forwarded con‚Äê[m
             nection.  An attacker cannot obtain key material from[m
             the agent, however they can perform operations on the[m
             keys that enable them to authenticate using the iden‚Äê[m
             tities loaded into the agent.  A safer alternative may[m

[1mAUTHENTICATION[0m[m
     The OpenSSH SSH client supports SSH protocol 2.[m
[m
     The methods available for authentication are: GSSAPI-based au‚Äê[m
     thentication, host-based authentication, public key authenti‚Äê[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 526 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     cation, keyboard-interactive authentication, and password au‚Äê[m
     thentication.  Authentication methods are tried in the order[m
     specified above, though [1mPreferredAuthentications[0m can be used[m
     to change the default order.[m
[m
     Host-based authentication works as follows: If the machine the[m
     user logs in from is listed in [4m/etc/hosts.equiv[24m or[m
     [4m/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv[24m on the remote machine, the user is non-[m
     root and the user names are the same on both sides, or if the[m
     files [4m~/.rhosts[24m or [4m~/.shosts[24m exist in the user's home direc‚Äê[m
     tory on the remote machine and contain a line containing the[m
     name of the client machine and the name of the user on that[m
     machine, the user is considered for login.  Additionally, the[m
     server [4mmust[24m be able to verify the client's host key (see the[m
     description of [4m/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts[24m and[m

     authentication method closes security holes due to IP spoof‚Äê[m
     ing, DNS spoofing, and routing spoofing.  [Note to the admin‚Äê[m
     istrator: [4m/etc/hosts.equiv[24m, [4m~/.rhosts[24m, and the rlogin/rsh pro‚Äê[m
     tocol in general, are inherently insecure and should be dis‚Äê[m
     abled if security is desired.][m
[m
     Public key authentication works as follows: The scheme is[m
     based on public-key cryptography, using cryptosystems where[m
     encryption and decryption are done using separate keys, and it[m
     is unfeasible to derive the decryption key from the encryption[m
     key.  The idea is that each user creates a public/private key[m
     pair for authentication purposes.  The server knows the public[m
     key, and only the user knows the private key.  [1mssh[0m implements[m
     public key authentication protocol automatically, using one of[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 556 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     the DSA, ECDSA, Ed25519 or RSA algorithms.  The HISTORY sec‚Äê[m
     tion of ssl(8) (on non-OpenBSD systems, see[m
     http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssl&sektion=8#HISTO[m RY)[m
     contains a brief discussion of the DSA and RSA algorithms.[m
[m
     The file [4m~/.ssh/authorized_keys[24m lists the public keys that are[m
     permitted for logging in.  When the user logs in, the [1mssh[0m pro‚Äê[m
     gram tells the server which key pair it would like to use for[m
     authentication.  The client proves that it has access to the[m
     private key and the server checks that the corresponding pub‚Äê[m
     lic key is authorized to accept the account.[m
[m
     The server may inform the client of errors that prevented pub‚Äê[m
     lic key authentication from succeeding after authentication[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 571 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     completes using a different method.  These may be viewed by[m
     increasing the [1mLogLevel[0m to [1mDEBUG[0m or higher (e.g. by using the[m
     [1m-v[0m flag).[m
[m
     The user creates their key pair by running ssh-keygen(1).[m
     This stores the private key in [4m~/.ssh/id_dsa[24m (DSA),[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_ecdsa[24m (ECDSA), [4m~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk[24m (authenticator-[m
     hosted ECDSA), [4m~/.ssh/id_ed25519[24m (Ed25519),[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk[24m (authenticator-hosted Ed25519), or[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_rsa[24m (RSA) and stores the public key in[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub[24m (DSA), [4m~/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub[24m (ECDSA),[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk.pub[24m (authenticator-hosted ECDSA),[m
     [4m~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub[24m (Ed25519), [4m~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk.pub[24m (au‚Äê[m
     thenticator-hosted Ed25519), or [4m~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub[24m (RSA) in the[m
     user's home directory.  The user should then copy the public[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 585 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     key to [4m~/.ssh/authorized_keys[24m in their home directory on the[m
     remote machine.  The [4mauthorized_keys[24m file corresponds to the[m
     conventional [4m~/.rhosts[24m file, and has one key per line, though[m
     the lines can be very long.  After this, the user can log in[m
     without giving the password.[m
[m
     A variation on public key authentication is available in the[m
     form of certificate authentication: instead of a set of pub‚Äê[m
     lic/private keys, signed certificates are used.  This has the[m
     advantage that a single trusted certification authority can be[m
     used in place of many public/private keys.  See the CERTIFI‚Äê[m
     CATES section of ssh-keygen(1) for more information.[m
[m
     The most convenient way to use public key or certificate au‚Äê[m
     thentication may be with an authentication agent.  See[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 600 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     ssh-agent(1) and (optionally) the [1mAddKeysToAgent[0m directive in[m
     ssh_config(5) for more information.[m
[m
     Keyboard-interactive authentication works as follows: The[m
     server sends an arbitrary "challenge" text and prompts for a[m
     response, possibly multiple times.  Examples of keyboard-in‚Äê[m
     teractive authentication include BSD Authentication (see[m
     login.conf(5)) and PAM (some non-OpenBSD systems).[m
[m
     Finally, if other authentication methods fail, [1mssh[0m prompts the[m
     user for a password.  The password is sent to the remote host[m
     for checking; however, since all communications are encrypted,[m
     the password cannot be seen by someone listening on the net‚Äê[m
     work.[m

     cryption.  The [1mStrictHostKeyChecking[0m option can be used to[m

     session.  All communication with the remote command or shell[m
     will be automatically encrypted.[m
[m
     If an interactive session is requested, [1mssh[0m by default will[m

     When connecting to a server for the first time, a fingerprint[m
     of the server's public key is presented to the user (unless[m
     the option [1mStrictHostKeyChecking[0m has been disabled).  Finger‚Äê[m
     prints can be determined using ssh-keygen(1):[m
[m
           $ ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 765 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K[m
     If the fingerprint is already known, it can be matched and the[m
     key can be accepted or rejected.  If only legacy (MD5) finger‚Äê[m
     prints for the server are available, the ssh-keygen(1) [1m-E[0m op‚Äê[m
     tion may be used to downgrade the fingerprint algorithm to[m
     match.[m
[m
     Because of the difficulty of comparing host keys just by look‚Äê[m
     ing at fingerprint strings, there is also support to compare[m
     host keys visually, using [4mrandom[24m [4mart[24m.  By setting the[m
     [1mVisualHostKey[0m option to ‚Äúyes‚Äù, a small ASCII graphic gets dis‚Äê[m
     played on every login to a server, no matter if the session[m
     itself is interactive or not.  By learning the pattern a known[m
     server produces, a user can easily find out that the host key[m
     has changed when a completely different pattern is displayed.[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 780 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     Because these patterns are not unambiguous however, a pattern[m
     that looks similar to the pattern remembered only gives a good[m
     probability that the host key is the same, not guaranteed[m
     proof.[m
[m
     To get a listing of the fingerprints along with their random[m
     art for all known hosts, the following command line can be[m
     used:[m
[m
           $ ssh-keygen -lv -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts[m
[m
     If the fingerprint is unknown, an alternative method of veri‚Äê[m
     fication is available: SSH fingerprints verified by DNS.  An[m
     additional resource record (RR), SSHFP, is added to a zonefile[m
     and the connecting client is able to match the fingerprint[m
[7m Manual page ssh(1) line 795 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     with that of the key presented.[m
[m
     In this example, we are connecting a client to a server,[m
     ‚Äúhost.example.com‚Äù.  The SSHFP resource records should first[m
     be added to the zonefile for host.example.com:[m
[m
           $ ssh-keygen -r host.example.com.[m
[m
     The output lines will have to be added to the zonefile.  To[m
     check that the zone is answering fingerprint queries:[m
[m
           $ dig -t SSHFP host.example.com[m
[m

     ssh(1) obtains configuration data from the following sources[m

                ([4m/etc/ssh/ssh_config[24m)[m
[m
     For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.[m
[7m Manual page ssh_config(5) line 1 (press h for help or q to quit)[27m[K[K     The configuration files contain sections separated by [1mHost[0m[m
     specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts[m
     that match one of the patterns given in the specification.[m
     The matched host name is usually the one given on the command[m
     line (see the [1mCanonicalizeHostname[0m option for exceptions).[m
[m
     Since the first obtained value for each parameter is used,[m
     more host-specific declarations should be given near the be‚Äê[m
     ginning of the file, and general defaults at the end.[m
[m
     Note that the Debian [1mopenssh-client[0m package sets several op‚Äê[m

     order to represent arguments containing spaces.  Configuration[m
     options may be separated by whitespace or optional whitespace[m
     and exactly one ‚Äò=‚Äô; the latter format is useful to avoid the[m
     need to quote whitespace when specifying configuration options[m

                ([4m/etc/ssh/ssh_config[24m)[m
[m
     For each parameter, the first obtained value will be used.[m
     The configuration files contain sections separated by [1mHost[0m[m
     specifications, and that section is only applied for hosts[m
     that match one of the patterns given in the specification.[m
     The matched host name is usually the one given on the command[m
     line (see the [1mCanonicalizeHostname[0m option for exceptions).[m
[m
